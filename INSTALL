The software for the Latero device is divided into libraries and programs. The latero-demo program (this project) is a Graphical User Interface that makes use of the latero graphics library (used to create tactile renders for the Latero device)

This release of the sofware has been tested on  Mac OS X Maverick and Yosemite. Please follow these instructions. If you've successfully built and run this software on another platform, please list the steps you followed below.

MAC OS X
*********

Step 0: Make sure the latero and latero-graphics library is installed
--------------------------------------------------
See instructions in INSTALL file for latero and latero-graphics projects.

Step 1: Install XQuartz 
------------------------ 
If you already have XQuartz, skip to step 2. Otherwise, install it from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/. X11 is no longer included with OS X.

Step 2: Build latero-demo
-----------------------------
-- Correct search path so .pkg files are found (By default, pkg files installed by users are not part of the search path). 
>> export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/ 
This needs to be done for each terminal that you start (as an alternative, you can add that line to the .profile file)
-- Build latero-gui
>> cmake . -G Xcode
>> sudo xcodebuild clean
>> sudo xcodebuild -target install

You should now be able to launch the program latero-demo from /src/Debug/.
